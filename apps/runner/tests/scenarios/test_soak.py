"""Load/soak scenario (docs/architecture.md §7): 60 simulated people,
sustained GID churn — drops, nearby respawns, and ambiguous respawns mixed
together — asserting the system never crashes, never double-binds a gid,
and no orphan is left stranded past its ritual.

Runs a compressed version (seconds, not a full show's runtime) so it's fast
enough for CI; the churn *rate* per player is what's under test, not wall
clock duration.
