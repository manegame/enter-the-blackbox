"""Scripted churn scenario: TrackingBox restarts mid-round (full resync).

Every GID resets. The game server must not treat this as a network blip to
patch around — the same resync path recovers it, and bound players who
vanish from the fresh snapshot are recorded absent, never wrong, when the
round closes (docs/architecture.md §4.1, §4.3, §7).
