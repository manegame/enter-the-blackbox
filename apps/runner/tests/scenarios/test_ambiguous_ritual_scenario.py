"""Scripted churn scenario: drop two GIDs near each other and respawn two.

This is the ambiguity -> orphaned -> ritual path (docs/architecture.md
§4.2, §7). The binding layer must never guess between two plausible
candidates; both players sit as orphaned until a ritual (or operator)
rebind resolves them. Asserts on binding_events, matching the plan's
"no orphan lasts longer than one ritual" exit criterion.
