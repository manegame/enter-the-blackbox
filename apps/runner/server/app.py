"""FastAPI entry point for the theater game server.

Phase 0 connected to TrackingBox and mirrored its audience state. Phase 1
added the player<->GID binding layer: claim flow, persisted state with crash
recovery, and a minimal admin binding board. Phase 2 added the round/scoring
engine and the player WebSocket. Phase 3 added the TouchDesigner round/cue
WS. Phase 4 adds auto-rebind, the ritual rebind flow, and round-state crash
recovery on top of Phase 1's binding-state recovery.
