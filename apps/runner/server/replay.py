"""Post-show replay: rebuild the full event timeline, or the binding/score
state at any single moment, from the persisted ``binding_events``/
``answers``/``score_events`` tables (docs/architecture.md §5, §7).

This is what makes "every rebind must be explainable after the show"
concrete rather than aspirational — a real question a director asks the
morning after ("why did seat-14 lose their points in round 3?") should be
answerable by pointing at a specific row, not a shrug.

Read-only: this module never writes, so it's safe to run against a live
show's PocketBase instance (concurrent HTTP reads are the normal case for
it) as well as after the fact.
