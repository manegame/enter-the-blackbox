"""Round state machine, timing, zone evaluation, and scoring
(docs/architecture.md §4.3).

Zone evaluation is per question: rounds with a ``zone_layout`` divide the
whole floor into that round's shape (server.zones) and each bound player's
answer zone is resolved from their live floor position. Rounds without a
layout ("choice" form) fall back to TrackingBox's own live ``zone`` field —
there the zone map fetched at startup is used only to validate content
(server.content), not to re-derive what TrackingBox already computes with
identical first-match semantics.

State machine per round: pending -> active -> closing -> revealed -> done.
At ``closing`` every bound player's current zone is captured as their
answer; players who are lost/orphaned are recorded ``absent``, never wrong.
During the grace window that follows, any player who reclaims a binding and
is standing in a valid answer zone is upgraded to ``late_grace``.
