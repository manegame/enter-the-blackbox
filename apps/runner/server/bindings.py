"""Player <-> GID binding state machine (docs/architecture.md §4.2).

State machine: unclaimed -> bound -> lost -> (bound | orphaned) -> bound.

* **Lost**: a bound GID disappears (individually, or via a TrackingBox
  restart's full resync). A per-player timer starts.
* **Auto-rebind**: whenever an unbound GID appears, it's matched against
  every lost/orphaned player by floor-position proximity and recency. If
  exactly one player is a plausible match, the rebind is silent. If more
  than one is plausible, we refuse to guess — see §4.2's "never guess
  between two candidates" — and leave everyone as they are.
  ``_plausible_rebind_candidates`` deliberately uses hard thresholds
  (distance + time-gap cutoffs) rather than a fully general weighted score
  matcher; retuning those thresholds from rehearsal telemetry is exactly
  the feedback loop the design doc describes for this section.
* **Orphaned**: a lost player who hasn't auto-rebound within
  ``orphan_after_s`` needs a ritual or operator rebind. Every unbound GID
  that steps into ``ritual_zone_id`` resolves the longest-waiting orphan.
