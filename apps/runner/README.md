# blackbox-runner

Interactive theater game server for 40+ simultaneous players. Positions come
from [TrackingBox](https://github.com/ale-rls/TrackingBox) (anonymous GIDs
over REST + WebSocket); players answer questions by physically moving into
floor zones.

TrackingBox is treated as a versioned, read-only sensor: this repo consumes
its `/ws` and `/api/zones` endpoints and never modifies it for game features.

**Pinned TrackingBox commit:** `95d092864ff8e24a2af9c33e662e547262692b04`
(update this line, and re-validate the show, whenever the pin moves).

## Development

Requires Python 3.11+ and a running TrackingBox instance (mock backend is
fine for all development and load testing):

```bash
# in a TrackingBox checkout at the pinned commit — bare mock, no zones/floor
audience-tracker serve --backend mock --port 8000

# or, to exercise zone-based gameplay (answers require floor projection):
audience-tracker serve --config /path/to/this/repo/dev/trackingbox.config.json --port 8000

# in this repo — import the show content once, then boot
make import-content
make dev
```

`dev/trackingbox.config.json` enables calibration (an identity mapping, since
the mock backend has no real camera) and defines the floor-marking zones
(`scale_*`, `cross_*`, `ring_*`, plus the `ritual` corner) matching
`content/show.yaml`. Without it, `floor_valid` stays false and no round can
ever be answered — only useful for Phase 0/1-style connectivity checks.

To enable ElevenLabs voice generation from the admin console, set
`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (and usually `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`; model defaults to
`eleven_multilingual_v2`) — see `docs/runbook.md` for the workflow.

`make dev` boots the game server against `ws://localhost:8000/ws`, loading
the show from the game DB (validated against TrackingBox's `/api/zones` at
startup — a content zone typo fails fast here rather than silently going
unanswerable mid-show) and the admin dashboard at `/admin/`. The DB is
seeded from the authoring copy with `make import-content` (or
`python scripts/import_content.py`); re-run it after every `show.yaml`
edit you want the server to pick up.

Run tests with `make test`.

### Personal audio streams

Set `AUDIO_BRIDGE_URL`, `AUDIO_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, and `AUDIO_PUBLIC_URL` to enable
the companion `blackbox-icecast` service. Every claimed player is allocated a
continuous Icecast stream; opening a round injects that round's mp3 into each
bound player's stream. If the bridge is disabled or unavailable, the existing
browser-triggered mp3 path remains the degraded fallback.

The bridge may run remotely on Coolify: the runner uploads the local MP3 over
the authenticated API before issuing play commands, so TrackingBox and this
runner can stay private on the venue network. See the companion
`blackbox-icecast/COOLIFY.md` deployment guide.

The operator dashboard also has a **Live personal audio** panel. Type an
announcement, optionally select player ids and a voice, then click **Generate &
play**. The runner calls ElevenLabs server-side, writes the resulting mp3 into
the shared audio directory, and injects it immediately—no visit to the
ElevenLabs site is needed.

### Player frontend (SvelteKit)

The player app lives in `frontend/player/` (SvelteKit, static SPA build).
Routes: **`/` is the one link to hand to every new audience member** — it
assigns a fresh seat id and redirects to `/p/{id}`; the id sticks in
localStorage so re-opening the link returns the same seat. Ushers can
still hand out explicit `/p/seat-12` links, which then become that
phone's sticky seat.

For rehearsals and failure-mode testing, `/listen` shows the current task
without claiming a player seat. It follows the live round stream, exposes
the current game state, and includes an audio player for narration.

The production build is committed (`build/`), so running the show needs
no Node — but after editing the frontend, rebuild and commit:

```bash
cd frontend/player
npm install        # once
npm run build      # writes build/, which the game server serves
npm run dev        # dev server with proxy to a game server on :8100
```

It talks to the game server's REST/WS endpoints exactly like the legacy
page, plus PocketBase realtime (public `rounds`/`score_events`
collections — the browser holds no credentials; it learns the PocketBase
URL from `GET /api/config`). If `build/` is missing, the server falls
back to the archived `web/player/index.html`.

**Standalone deployment** (e.g. a Coolify static site, separate from the
game server): build with the game server's public URL baked in —

```bash
VITE_GAME_URL=https://game.example.com npm run build
```

— and deploy `build/` to any static host (SPA fallback to `index.html`).
The game server allows cross-origin API calls, and audio/WS URLs are
rewritten to point at `VITE_GAME_URL` automatically.

Note: TrackingBox's default mock simulator churns GIDs quite aggressively
(people can disappear and respawn sub-second). That's a good stress test —
it's exactly what Phase 4's auto-rebind exists for — but makes manual
single-player demos flaky if you're just claiming once and watching; favor
scripted checks over live clicking when verifying binding behavior by hand.

### Ritual rebind (Phase 4)

Set `RITUAL_ZONE_ID` to enable the ritual rebind flow (an orphaned player —
lost with no confident auto-rebind after `ORPHAN_AFTER_S` seconds, default
3 — gets prompted to a lit corner; whichever unbound GID enters that zone
resolves them). `dev/trackingbox.config.json` defines a `ritual` zone in
the top-left corner for local testing:

```bash
RITUAL_ZONE_ID=ritual make dev
```

Other tunables (see `server/config.py`): `REBIND_MAX_DISTANCE` (normalized
floor units, default 0.15), `REBIND_MAX_GAP_S` (default 8.0). These are
exactly the thresholds §4.2/§7 of the design doc expect to be retuned from
rehearsal telemetry — there's no "correct" value without a real venue.
